# VIVO Vagrant

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration and install scripts for running [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) on an Ubuntu 64 Precise image.

The VIVO web application will be available at `http://localhost:8080/vivo`.  The source will be at `/usr/local/vivo/`.

The box will boot and install VIVO 1.6 and dependencies.  This will take several minutes for the initial install.

## Prerequisites
 * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
 * [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html).

## Install the VIVO Vagrant box

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant.git vivo-vagrant
$ cd vivo-vagrant
$ vagrant up
~~~

## Notes
 * This is intended for development only.  Change passwords if you intend to use this config for deployment.
 * The source at `/usr/local/vivo` is based off a [template](https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-project-template) and under git
 version control.
 * On older versions of Vagrant it might be necessary to start Vagrant with the `$ vagrant up --no-provision` flag to prevent the VIVO installation script from running each time.
 * Various other development tools, mainly Python, are installed too.  Comment those out if they are not needed.
 * Vagrant supports virtualization utilities other than [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) but this package hasn't been tested with those.  Please report back if you are using another tool with this package.
