# VIVO Vagrant

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration and install scripts for running [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) on a virtual machine, aka [Vagrant box](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html), running an Ubuntu 64 Precise image.

The virtual machine will boot and install VIVO 1.6 and its dependencies.  This will take several minutes for the initial install.

## Prerequisites
 * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
 * [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html).
 * Git - if you are new to git, you might want to use the Github desktop client. [Windows](http://windows.github.com/) and [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) versions are available.

## Install the VIVO Vagrant box

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant.git vivo-vagrant
$ cd vivo-vagrant
$ vagrant up
~~~

When the Vagrant provisioning script is complete, the VIVO web application will be available in a browser on the host machine at `http://localhost:8080/vivo`.  You can log into your new VIVO with the default admin user (`vivo_root@school.edu`) and password (`rootPassword`), which are specified in the `/provision/vivo/deploy.properties` source file in this repository.

The source will be installed on the virtual machine at `/usr/local/vivo/`. Mac users can log into your Vagrant box securely using this command from a Terminal session.  Windows users will want to use an SSH utility, e.g. [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html):

~~~
$ vagrant ssh
~~~

Once you are logged in, you can view the default VIVO log output with this command:

~~~
$ vlog
~~~


### Commands / system layout
 * VIVO application: `/usr/local/vivo`
 * VIVO data directory: `/usr/local/vdata`
 * Tomcat: `/var/lib/tomcat7/`
 * To start/stop Tomcat run `sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat start|stop|restart`.
 * A Vagrant [shared directory](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/) is available at `/work` from the box. 
 
### Background
 * This Vagrant box is intended for development only.  Change default user names and passwords if you intend to use this config for a production deployment.
 * The source at `/usr/local/vivo` is based off a [template](https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-project-template) and under git version control.
 * On older versions of Vagrant it might be necessary to start Vagrant with the `$ vagrant up --no-provision` flag to prevent the VIVO installation script from running each time.
 * Vagrant supports virtualization utilities other than [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) but this package hasn't been tested with those.  Please report back if you have adapted this to work with another virtulaization tool.  

## Updates to VIVO and Vitro code
 * From time to time, updates will be made to the current VIVO or Vitro release.  To make sure your VIVO Vagrant box is running the latest code.  Login to your box, shutdown Tomcat, and checkout the latest [VIVO](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO) and [Vitro](https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro) code from Github.  For example:
 
 ~~~
 $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop
 $ cd /usr/local/vivo
 $ cd VIVO
 $ git pull
 $ cd ../Vitro
 $ git pull
 $ cd ..
 $ sudo ant all
 $ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 start
 ~~~
 * You can also, at anytime, re-provision your Vagrant box.  By running the following from your host machine.  Be sure to backup any data or code changes you have made beforehand.  
 
 ~~~
 $ vagrant up --provision
 ~~~

 * If you are interested in running VIVO 1.5, you can run checkout the v1.5 branch of this repository.  
 ~~~
 $ git clone https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant.git vivo-vagrant
 $ cd vivo-vagrant
 $ git checkout v1.5
 $ vagrant up
 ~~~
